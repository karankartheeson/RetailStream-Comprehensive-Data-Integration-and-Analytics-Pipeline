Hereâ€™s a GitHub README file for your "RetailStream: Comprehensive Data Integration and Analytics Pipeline" project:
RetailStream: Comprehensive Data Integration and Analytics Pipeline
Project Overview

RetailStream is a data pipeline solution designed for a large retail chain struggling to integrate data from multiple stores. By automating data ingestion, cleaning, processing, and orchestration, the pipeline aims to generate real-time insights for decision-making, improve inventory management, and enhance business performance.
Technologies Used

    Apache Spark for data processing.
    AWS Services: S3, RDS, Glue, Lambda, EMR.
    HDFS and Hive for feature data management.
    Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration.
    Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

Problem Statement

The retail chain faced issues with manual data consolidation, leading to delayed and inaccurate insights. This project solves these challenges by creating an automated, end-to-end data pipeline that manages and integrates data from multiple stores, providing actionable insights.
Business Use Cases

The following analyses were conducted to support business decisions:

    Customer Visit Analysis: Average customer visits in type B stores during April.
    Holiday Sales Analysis: Average sales during holiday weeks across all store types.
    Leap Year Sales Analysis: Store with the worst sales performance during leap years.
    Sales Prediction with Unemployment Factor: Sales forecast when unemployment is greater than 8%.
    Monthly Sales Aggregation: Total monthly sales for each department.
    Weekly High Sales Store Identification: Top-performing store on a weekly basis.
    Department Performance Analysis: Performance analysis of departments across all weeks.
    Fuel Price Analysis: Store with the minimum fuel price on a week-wise basis.
    Yearly Store Performance Analysis: Store performance on a year-wise basis.
    Weekly Performance Analysis with/without Offers: Comparison of store performance with and without offers.

Approach
Stage 1: Data Ingestion and Initial Processing

    Sales files are transferred from a local system to an S3 bucket.
    AWS Glue cleans and merges files in S3 into a new bucket on a scheduled basis.
    A Lambda function loads the data from the S3 bucket to AWS RDS.

Stage 2: Feature Data Management

    Feature files are stored in HDFS and cleaned using PySpark before being pushed to Hive tables.

Stage 3: Data Consolidation

    Store data is loaded into AWS RDS, cleaned if necessary, and transferred to Hive using Sqoop.

Stage 4: Integration of Stages

    The environment is designed to integrate the first three stages seamlessly.

Stage 5: Data Storage and Processing

    PySpark jobs are used to store processed data in AWS RDS or files based on business requirements.

Stage 6: Pipeline Orchestration

    An Apache Airflow pipeline orchestrates all stages from data ingestion to processing.

Stage 7: Monitoring

    Prometheus monitors the entire pipeline from ingestion to processing, ensuring data quality and reliability.
